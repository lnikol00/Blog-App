      "body": "Lorem Ipsum comes from a latin text written in 45BC by Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and philosopher, Marcus Tullius Cicero. The text is titled de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum which means The Extremes of Good and Evil. The most common form of Lorem ipsum is the following:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.The text is a corrupted version of the original and therefore does not mean anything in particular. The book however where it originates discusses the philosophical views of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and the Platonism of Antiochus of Ascalon.Lorem ipsum is widely in use since the 14th century and up to today as the default dummy random text of the typesetting and web development industry. In fact not only it has survived the test of time but it thrived and can be found in many software products, from Microsoft Word to WordPress. Random Text Generator is a web application which provides true random text which you can use in your documents or web designs. How does it work? First we took many books available on project Gutenberg and stored their contents in a database. Then a computer algorithm takes the words we stored earlier and shuffles them into sentences and paragraphs.The algorithm takes care to create text that looks similar to an ordinary book but without any real meaning. The reason we want our text to be meaningless is that we want the person viewing the resulting random text to focus on the design we are presenting, rather than try to read and understand the text.It's better than Lorem ipsum because it can produce text in many languages and in particular: Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian and Spanish.Also when you use plain Lorem ipsum text, your design will look like a million other designs out there. With Random Text Generator your designs will look more unique while still containing text which truly means nothing.",

      "body": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

      "body": "Mount’s club team-mate Wesley Fofana (£4.3m) was called up to France’s senior squad for the first time but has had to pull out because of a hamstring injury suffered during the 2-2 draw with Everton. For those without Chelsea defensive coverage, cheap centre-back Fofana would’ve been an interesting way in, having started all matches since Potter switched to a wing-back system.\n\nSpurs duo Ben Davies (£4.8m) and Richarlison (£8.4m) were both hurt early in the dramatic 3-3 draw at Southampton and quickly taken off. Neither will be involved with their national sides.\n\nAcross north London, Mikel Arteta gave updates on defensive pair Takehiro Tomiyasu (£4.2m) and William Saliba (£5.2m). He admits “it’s not looking good” for the former but is more optimistic about the latter.\n\nSven Botman (£4.5m) and Cody Gakpo (£7.7m) had to leave the Netherlands training camp on Thursday but Newcastle United reporter Chris Waugh suggests the pair could still return for the second of the Oranje’s international fixtures.\n\nNedo je klošar",
